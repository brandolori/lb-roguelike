# How to play
Use WASD to move the @ around.  
Use the arrow keys to shoot in a direction.  
Your goal is to defeat all the enemies in each room and then go through the door in the bottom of the room.  
Each weapon you pick up has limited number of hits, and then it gets destroyed, leaving you with a permanent powerup.
